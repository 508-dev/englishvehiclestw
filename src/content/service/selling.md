If you've ever tried to sell something on Facebook Marketplace in Taiwan, you probably know by now that the majority of buyers in Taiwan
speak little to no English. If you want to get the best price possible for your motorcycle, car, or scooter that you're trying to sell, quickly,
your best bet is to manage the sales process in Mandarin.

Fortunately, our business started in sales and mechanic work, and so we're very familiar with the process of selling vehicles in Taiwan.
Call or message us for a free consultation and overview of the general sales process in Taiwan, including recommendations on where to list,
general pricing guidelines for your vehicle's model, and the typical paperwork you'll need to file at the DMV when selling the vehicle.

Or, for a commission-based pricing model, let us leverage our expertise and fluent English / Chinese language skills to handle the
whole process for you. We can take care of listing the vehicle, negotiating with Chinese speakers, investigating if selling to a dealership
is a good course of action, pre-sales inspection and maintenance, and DMV paperwork filing. The reality is, Taiwanese buyers are usually much more comfortable
buying from non-citizens when there's a Taiwanese company and fluent Chinese language speaker involved, dramatically expanding the options
available to you when you sell through us!

Depending on your vehicle, we may even be interested in purchasing it ourselves, for the sake of buying. Furthermore, if you find yourself
in the unfortunate circumstance of owning scooter or motorcycle that's been significantly damaged in a collision, we may be interested
in purchasing it for the purpose of fixing it up and selling it.

Give us a call or [send us a message](/about/contact)!
