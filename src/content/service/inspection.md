All motorized vehicles in Taiwan must be inspected once a year. If you choose, you can do this yourself by taking your vehicle to your local DMV, waiting in line a few hours, and undergoing the inspection.

There are some "gotchas" with this process that may, however, cause your inspection to fail, forcing you to return on another day and wait in line again to try to pass. For example, any and all modifications to red and yellow plate motorcycles are illegal and will cause an inspection to fail - even an LED headlight swap!

Our English-Speaking motor vehicle inspection assitance service offers the following, at various price points:

* Helping you gather the proper paperwork required during inspection (call or message us for free consultation!)
* Preparing your motorcycle, car, or scooter for inspection by swapping custom parts for legal parts
* Taking your vehicle and paperwork to the DMV and having the government inspection performed for you
* Delivering your vehicle to you at the location of your choosing with custom parts restored and re-calibrated, along with your paperwork, as well as English-fluent advice on anything that was noticed during inspection that may be legitimate maintenance needs or other paperwork-related concerns.

If you have the time, energy, and confidence to navigate the generally Mandarin-only environment of the DMV inspection process on your own, we are happy to chat with you and make sure you have the paperwork you need, and answer any questions you have about custom equipment. Should you prefer to let us handle the process for you and take the weight off your shoulders, we're more than happy to handle the whole bureaucratic process for you, leaving you free to enjoy the fun parts of owning a motorcycle, scooter, or car in Taiwan.

Pricing: Typically 2000ntd for full-service, paperwork consultation and filing, and modification of vehicle to pass inspection (and swapping parts back before returning to you). Door-to-door option for your apartment or house available for extra 1600ntd within most parts of Taipei and New Taipei City, other locations available for extra fee. We're happy to transparently and frankly discuss cost options with you, feel free to give us a call or send us a message!
