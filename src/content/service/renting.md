Renting a car, motorcycle, or scooter in Taiwan can be a headache. The ability to do so is based
less on law, and more on the current attitudes and beliefs of rental agencies. For example,
non-citizens are perfectly legally capable of renting a scooter on an international driver's license,
however some shops, especially in the south of Taiwan, simply don't believe this to be true, and no
amount of negotiating with them or showing them printed out laws will change their minds.

Furthermore, there are tricky legal requirements around insurance that can trip up even the most
prepared of visitors or new residents of Taiwan.

We don't (yet!) rent out vehicles, however we are more than happy to chat with you about rental
agencies we trust in cities across Taiwan, as well as talk you through the best way to ensure you
can rent a vehicle when you arrive. Don't be caught out in the cold when your train arrives in Hualien
and you find out nobody wants to rent to you because you don't have the correct paperwork! Give us a call
or shoot us a message first, and we'll make sure you're sorted properly, in fluent English.

No charge for these services, and no, we don't get kick-backs from rental agencies. We offer this service for
free because it was one of our biggest headaches when some of us moved to Taiwan, and also
because it costs us very little time or effort to help out others in this area.

Give us a call or [send us a message](/about/contact)!
