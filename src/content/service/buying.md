Even in your home country, buying a new car, motorcycle, or scooter, can be daunting. Manufacturers aren't interested
in working together to help you figure out which option is best for your needs, they all just want to sell you their
car!  Even if you can narrow down to a few specific vehicle models, finding these models on the used or new vehicle
market can sometimes be outright impossible. Then, of course, there's always the risk of being sold a lemon!

Establishing a new life in a new country comes with enough headaches; let us help take one more off your shoulders.
We provide various vehicle purchasing related services, including free consultations on what kind of vehicle is
right for your or your family's needs, helping align your expectations with our decades-long and up-to-date
experience with the unique pre-owned and new Taiwan car, scooter, and motorcycle markets.

We also offer commission-based purchasing assistance for cars, scooters, and motorcycles, including sourcing
from used, pre-owned, and new vehicles from our curated network of dealers and private sellers. Since most
sellers only speak Chinese, and since all paperwork for vehicle purchases must be filed in Chinese, we also
offer English-language negotiation and filing assistance. Finally, to make sure you don't end up buying a
lemon, we can inspect any vehicle before you buy, acting as a neutral third party and giving you a clear
picture of any maintenance requirements for vehicle, and rooting out any nasty surprises.

If you want peace of mind, let us help you buy your car, scooter, or motorcycle in Taiwan!
