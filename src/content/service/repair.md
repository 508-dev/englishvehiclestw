Even back home, mechanics love to try to bowl you over with excessive jargon to extract a little
bit more in service and repair fees for you, for services you may not even need, or not need yet.
The problem is even worse if you don't fluently speak the local language, and there are far fewer
English speaking motor vehicle mechanics than most professions in Taiwan. If you want fair, effective
service for your vehicle, your best bet is to find someone that can speak English.

We offer every maintenance and repair service imaginable for every motorized vehicle under the sun. If
we can't fix it, we'll connect you with someone who can, and help you translate while communicating with
them.

Don't trust you or your family's safety to a potential mis-translation. Let us service your vehicle
and guarantee against communication errors leading to unhappy accidents on the road. Don't worry, though we
have fluent English ability, we offer competitive pricing compared to Chinese speaking mechanics.
