Are you aware of the minimum insurance requirements in Taiwan? Did you know that the official
government-provided FAQs on this information can be wrong, and if so, the Chinese version always
takes precedence? Though Taiwan has been making great strides in making more legal content available
in English, at the end of the day, to be safe, you have to be reading laws and legalese in Chinese.

When it comes to car, scooter, and motorcycle insurance, mis-interpreting the laws can lead to
sometimes hefty fines, and in the worse case scenario of a collission, an unscrupulous insurance
company can leave you hanging out to dry. For peace of mind, we can help connect you with
reputable insurance companies, and communicate the rules to you in plain and fluent English.
We can also simply sell you car, scooter, and motorcycle insurance directly, at competetive
local rates.

Don't risk a mistranslation that you only discover years later when a scooter turns right
without looking, straight into your car, and you find yourself holding the bag because
that specific kind of collission wasn't covered! Choose peace of mind and fluent English
car, scooter, and motorcycle insurance options through us.
