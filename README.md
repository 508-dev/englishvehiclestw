## Project Services and Operator
Fluent English / Chinese motor vehicle services are managed almost entirely by Mr. Lobster.
Why he's called Mr. Lobster remains a mystery, as does the origin of his fluent English ability. He's a Malaysian-born Taiwanese permanent resident with over a decade of experience fixing, buying, and selling cars, scooters, and motorcycles in Taiwan.
