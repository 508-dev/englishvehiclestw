# English-Language Car, Motorcycle, and Scooter Services in Taiwan

Interested in owning, or already own, a car, motorcycle, or scooter in Taiwan, 
and daunted by the labyrinthian Chinese-language bureaucracy? 

## Let our bilingual English- and Mandarin-speaking staff help out! 

Whatever your motor vehicle related needs are in Taiwan, we can help. Contact us today, or read more about our services below.

## Project Services and Operator
Fluent English / Chinese motor vehicle services are managed almost entirely by Mr. Lobster.
Why he's called Mr. Lobster remains a mystery, as does the origin of his fluent English ability. He's a Malaysian-born Taiwanese permanent resident with over a decade of experience fixing, buying, and selling cars, scooters, and motorcycles in Taiwan.

## Website Development/Maintenance
This website was built by Caleb Rogers, a member of the software engineering co-op [508.dev](https://508.dev). 508.dev is a design and development firm with a unique structure that allows it to beat any other engineering consultancy or agency on price and outcomes.
The website was built in Astro. The Cirrus CSS library was leveraged. The source code is available for viewing and licensed under AGPL-3. The content of the site is copyrighted by 508.dev, 2024.
The motorcycle favicon was provided by Freepik. Favicons were generated using realfavicongenerator.net. 

## Local Development

1. Install packages:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server on port 3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. You can also test the static build by first creating a build, and then serving it:

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

4. Run the linter to automatically fix linting issues

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Project Management

508.dev strives to keep project management up to date to make it as easy as possible
to contribute to our FOSS projects. Usually, our project-management system is built into
wherever you're viewing this repository. In this case, that's codeberg.

You can see open tickets on our KANBAN board at: https://codeberg.org/508_dev/quick-taiwan-conversions/projects/8668 .
Tickets are categorized as beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Feel free to
assign a ticket to yourself, or leave a comment asking any questions! Also feel
free to create any new issues for any features you'd like to recommend.
