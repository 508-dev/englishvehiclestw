# English-Language Car, Motorcycle, and Scooter Services in Taiwan

Interested in owning, or already own, a car, motorcycle, or scooter in Taiwan, 
and daunted by the labyrinthian Chinese-language bureaucracy? 

## Let our bilingual English- and Mandarin-speaking staff help out! 

Whatever your motor vehicle related needs are in Taiwan, we can help. Contact us today, or read more about our services below.

## Project Services and Operator
Fluent English / Chinese motor vehicle services are managed almost entirely by Mr. Lobster.
Why he's called Mr. Lobster remains a mystery, as does the origin of his fluent English ability. He's a Malaysian-born Taiwanese permanent resident with over a decade of experience fixing, buying, and selling cars, scooters, and motorcycles in Taiwan.

## Website Development/Maintenance
This website was built by Caleb Rogers, a member of the software engineering co-op [508.dev](https://508.dev). 508.dev is a design and development firm with a unique structure that allows it to beat any other engineering consultancy or agency on price and outcomes.
The website was built in Astro. The Cirrus CSS library was leveraged. The source code is available for viewing and licensed under AGPL-3. The content of the site is copyrighted by 508.dev, 2024.
The motorcycle favicon was provided by Freepik. Favicons were generated using realfavicongenerator.net. 

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
